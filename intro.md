## Projects

1. [Graupel 1](https://graupel-1.sea7aero.space/)
   
   Our first high altitude balloon project. Mostly successful, but the GoPro batteries gave out too early so we repeated the mission.

1. Graupel-2

    Our second high altitude balloon project. This time, we successfully filmed the entire mission and retrieved the payload safely.

1. [Sprite 1](projects/sprite-1/docs/index) - "Operation Whale Drop"

    Our third, planned, balloon project.  This time with using a RC plane as the payload, with the intention of flying back to the launch site.
